Framework Genie 0.1 is a modest attempt to solve on the most difficult problem in their life of a Front end architect today
        - 'Which Framework to choose'?
Most front end architects today face a lot of issues after choosing a framework jsut based on its popularity, as there is no true 
comparison matrix that can help do a SWOT analysis on the framework.

This is where Framework Genie comes in. The idea is abstract all analysis from the engineer (end user of the product) and just 
her/him choose a framework based a set ( rather a bunch ) of questions very intelligently stitched together. As simple as that!

But, the simpler it gets for the engineer, the higher is the level of difficulty for us.

Coming soon .... Keep watching this space for more.
