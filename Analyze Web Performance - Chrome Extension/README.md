<h4>How about a Chrome Browser Extension to measure the Page load performance and other details to analyse the load time of your web page ? </h4>
<ul>
	<li>The Page load time is right there for every tab to indicate the slow or fast loading. Also 4 set of icons to display how fast the site is.</li>
	<li>Interactive UI with detailed explanation of Page load workflow.</li>
	<li>Shows information regarding empty image src, redirect count and Iframes which is not there in net tab or any extension</li>
	<li>Also we donâ€™t have to open the net tab by pressing F12 every time, clear the cache and see page load details. It is all tied to each tab and information is present all the time</li>
	<li>Also captures all JS/CSS and Image load times and provides data on whether they are internal/ external or sub domain files.</li>
	<li>Managers/BA/Clients can easily see the page load time without much technical knowledge and using this extension is a cake walk</li>
	<li>Built on top of HTML5 window.performance and native Javascript</li>
</ul>

<p>A quick tip: If you see the extension not loading or not showing the data, please clear your browser cache and open a new browser window and it should work. Also the extension wont actually work on the chrome store or extensions page.</p>
